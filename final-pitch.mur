#header <nothing-to-see-here>
//^ The header is used to give the compiler nessessary information before it

//The available flags are:
//"no-comments": can be used to tell the compiler to not look for comments in this
//file
//"no-preprocessor-methods": can be used to tell the compiler that this file does
//not contain any preprocessor methods
//"skip-processor": can be used to tell the compiler to not compile the code after
//the header, and jump to the C compiler compiling stage.
