# Murmur

Murmur - *you may also refer to it by "Mur" or "ECMSL-2021" (EnderCommunity Maintained Scripting Language - 2021)* - is an experimental programming language. ***It's still not even functional, this is all just a pitch of the language itself.*** *Mur* code compiles down to C code, which is then compiled to machine code.

The file extension of *Mur* files is *`.mur`*.

The file extension of *Mur* module files is *`.murm`*. (Which stands for *`"Murmur Module"`*)

## Contributing

Everyone is welcomed to contribute to this project in any way they want. (e.g. help code the compiler, or help with the pitching process)

## The Compiling Process

This is a diagram of the current plan for the compiling process:

![plan.png](./github/photos/plan.svg)

## Compiler input

For now, you can send input to the compiler in two ways:

- *By drag-dropping the desired file on the `start.exe` executable.*

- *By starting the `start.exe` executable and typing in the path of the desired file.*

## Syntax and Functions

***Empty, check the provided `.mur` files for now!***

## Extensions

You'll find instructions on how to use the provided extensions for the perfect development environment.

### Visual Studio Code

Copy the extension folder *`/murmur-vsc`* to the extension directory.

*The extension folder directory on Windows is `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions`*.

*The extension folder directory on  Mac/Linux is `$HOME/.vscode/extensions`*.

## To-Do List

There are instructions for the building process of the compiler and libraries of Murmur:
*Follow the instructions in the `test.mur` file on how should the language work*

- [ ] *Research the best algorithms for an efficient memory-managment*
- [ ] *Write a compiler using C that compiles Murmur to C code*
