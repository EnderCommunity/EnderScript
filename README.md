Murmur - *you may also refer to it by "Mur" or "ECMPL-2021" (EnderCommunity-Maintained Programming Language -- 2021)* - is an experimental programming language. *Mur* code compiles down to C code, which is then compiled to machine code.

>***"Mur" is still not functional, this is all just some pitches and some not-even-close-to-half-baked code.***
