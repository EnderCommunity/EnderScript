> **Note**: I'm currently quite busy with school, but I'll still try working on this project. I'm not leaving this project to die like my other projects. The development cycle is just going to be way way way way way way too long.

Murmur - *you may also refer to it by "Mur" or "ECMPL-2021" (EnderCommunity-Maintained Programming Language -- 2021)* - is an experimental programming language. *Mur* code compiles down to C code, which is then compiled to machine code.

>***"Mur" is still not functional, this is all just some pitches and some not-even-close-to-half-baked code.***
