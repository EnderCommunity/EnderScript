# EnderScript

EnderScript - *you may also refer to it by "ES" or "ECMSL-2021" (EnderCommunity Maintained Scripting Language 2021)* - is an experimental programming language. ***It's still not even functional, this is all just a pitch of the language itself.*** *ES* code compiles down to C code, which is then compiled to machine code.

The file extension of *ES* files is *`.esf`*. (Which stands for *`"EnderScript File"`*)

## Syntax and Functions

***Check the file `test.esf` for more info***

## Extensions

You'll find instructions on how to use the provided extensions for the perfect development environment.

### Visual Studio Code

Copy the extension folder *`/enderscript-vsc`* to the extension directory.

*The extension folder directory on Windows is `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions`*.

*The extension folder directory on  Mac/Linux is `$HOME/.vscode/extensions`*.

## To-Do List

There are instructions for the building process of the compiler and libraries of EnderScript:
*Follow the instructions in the `test.esf` file on how should the language work*

- [ ] *Research the best algorithms for an efficient memory-managment*
- [ ] *Write a first-post compiler using C that compiles the basic parts of EnderScript (e.g. preprocessor, types, functions, classes, string manipulation, and files managment)*
- [ ] *Write a second-post compiler using EnderScript that compiles the rest of the language fundamentals and functionality (e.g. memory processing and garbage collection, objects, and classes)*
