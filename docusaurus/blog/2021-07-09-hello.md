Hello, and welcome to our new development blog! We hope that this blog will help us convey our plans and feelings on our future decisions regarding this project, Mur.

We hope that Mur will not fail to fulfil your technical needs. But, to ensure total satisfaction from our future programming language users, we need your help! It's crucial (for us) to know what you need from Mur to ensure your needs' fulfilment.

Because of this, we have decided to introduce a feedback & suggestions section to our website. You, the user, will be able to carve and shape the future of Mur.

Of course, building a perfectly working programming language will take lots of time and hard work - let alone the time it will take to create a fully functional platform to help Mur become a worthy and helpful programming language for you.

To sum up, we can't do this alone. This whole project is to be taken care of by the community. We will need help from the community to help the community.
