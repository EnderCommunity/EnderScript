# The Preprocessor

The preprocessor is the bit of code that prepares the source code for the compiler to work on. It's supposed to check the header for flags, and analyse the preprocessor methods outside of *groups*. It also cleans unnecessary whitespaces and comments.

## Preprocessor Input

The preprocessor receives the `.mur` file you passed to the compiler, it then start processing the whole code inside that file.

## Preprocessor Output

The output of the preprocessor is a `.tmp` file.
