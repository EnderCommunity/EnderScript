:::note Note
We took this course of action to allow no one to profit off selling a compiler that is only to help and enrich the open-source community. This license grants a developer - who might have a better vision for this programming language or compiler - the right to do whatever pleases them, without denying others good opportunities for potential future projects/visions.
:::

This license **only** applies to Murmur's Compiler - the compiler available in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/EnderCommunity/Murmur) - and the programming language itself - as in syntax and rules -, not the programs built using this programming language. **Your projects, code, and programs are not in any way restricted by this license.**

You, the developer, are granted complete control of the compiler. But you may never distribute your new compiler under the same name.
