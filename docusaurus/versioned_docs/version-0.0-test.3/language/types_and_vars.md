# Types and Variables

Variables are symbols that work as placeholders for expressions and values. And, in Mur, variables have types.

## Defining Variables

To define a variable, you simply type in the type of the variable, followed by its name:

```mur
<type> Name;
```

You can assign a value to variables like this:

```mur
Name = <value>;
<type> Name2 = <value>;
```

### Int
