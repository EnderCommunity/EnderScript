EnderScript | (C) EnderCommunity
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an experimental language that is to be kept a secure for now. It's still
not even functional.

This is a pitch file for EnderScript that will include the general syntax for
EnderScript, and all the functions that it can use.

//(!) It is recommended that you start variable names with a capital letter!

int Num1 = 0, Num2 = 1, Num3 = 2; //Integers use the type 'int'

float Floa1 = 0.00, Floa2 = 0.01, Floa3 = 0.02; //Decimal numbers use the type 'float'

double Doub1 = 0.00, Doub2 = 0.01, Doub3 = 0.02; //Decimal numbers, that may be long, use the type 'double'

char Cha1 = 'A', Cha2 = 'B', Cha3 = 'C'; //You can also use normal quotes ("E"), characters use the type 'char'

string Str1 = "Hello there!", Str2 = "I'm a string!", Str3 = "I can be up to 2048 characters in length!"; //You can use variables with the type 'string' to store text


//Maybe don't give developers access to these functions
/*Allocate<int> AllocatedNumber = 10; //You can use the 'alloc<type>' identifier to allocate a specific amount of bytes
Pointer<int> Poi1 = Num1;
Pointer<double> Poi2 = Doub1;*/
//point a as fjekfakwfwa;

//You could make it so the user can specify a block of code that will not be
//parsed by the compiler. It would be basically a block of code that will run
//C code without any parser interferance.

//EnderScript should automatically detect the use of libraries, and include them in the final C code!

//(Introduce Rules in EnderScript???)
